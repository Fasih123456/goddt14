For example, the registered owner or their legal agent must donate the car. Automobile must be registered in Canada. Vehicle must be "complete" and without any significant component deficiencies. Vehicles with body damage are accepted. RVs, trailers, and boats will be subject to further restrictions. We are unable to accept vehicles that have insurance claims pending.

    Yes, we can take automobiles that aren't running.

    Once it has been picked up by our towing provider and is being recycled, your car no longer needs insurance. We advise you to maintain coverage on your car until it is sold if it is coming up for auction. When your car has been sold, we'll send you an email to let you know.
    `

    `
    Within 48 hours, one of our towing agents will get in touch with you. You may then plan for the pick-up of your car at a time that is most convenient for you.

    The vehicle's registered owner is the rightful owner of the licence plates. The auction house or recycling company will store or remove the licence plates if they are still attached to the car when it is donated. To prevent a non-registered owner from using the plate, recyclers often smash, shred, or mark it.

    When licence plates are returned to the provincial registry, a minor reimbursement may be offered in some jurisdictions. Simply take off your licence plates at the time of pick-up if you want to keep them, or ask one of our tow assistance representatives to do it for you. They'll be glad to assist you! 

Please be aware that your city's parking authority may confiscate any automobiles left on public streets without licence plates. Although it doesn't happen often, the city may impounded your car if it is left unregistered on the street before our towing personnel arrive. These impound fees are not the responsibility of InTow.

    The cost of having your car towed is not your responsibility. The cost of towing is covered if the car is recycled. The towing fee is subtracted from the vehicle's sale price if it is consigned to the auction.
