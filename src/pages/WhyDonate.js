                <p style={{paddingBottom:"20px"}}>The Overhead Solution, developed in 2013 by Guidestar, BBB Wise Giving Alliance, and Charity Navigator, is supported by the Car Donation Foundation in its effort to dispel the myth that financial ratios are the only measure of a nonprofit's performance. By showing our value based on impact, exhibiting ethical behaviour and transparent data about our performances, managing towards results, and assisting in educating funders on the true expenses of our programmes, InTpw seeks to transcend the Overhead Myth.
